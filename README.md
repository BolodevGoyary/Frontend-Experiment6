## Description
This is a basic To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The tasks are stored in **Local Storage**, so they persist even after closing or refreshing the browser.

## Features

- Mark tasks as complete by clicking on them
- Delete tasks
- Tasks persist using Local Storage

## Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML page
- `style.css` - Styling for the application
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality using Local Storage

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Start adding, completing, and deleting tasks.

No server setup is required as it runs entirely in the browser.
